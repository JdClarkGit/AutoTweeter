# autonomous_tweeting_software
A twitter bot but autonomous, and more powerful.

The user simply has to prompt it on the topic it wants to write a tweet or thread about on their profile and through
an integration with an LLM, airtable and twitter API - they are able to programmatically tweet without touching their keyboard.
